# MultiplayerZombies
This is a project done for a summer class taught by Eli Bucher and Jack Bachman.

The goal of this porject is to create a Multiplayer Zombie game.

MultiplayerZombies uses WebSockets to communicate with a Heroku server.
Both the backend and the front end are writen in Java and are both contained within this project.
To run the game locally set the LOCAL var in client > Client to true and the LOCAL var in server > communicator > Communicator to true.

JBox2D is used as the physics engine for the game.
